This project was all about looking at test scores across schools to see what might affect student performance. Using Python and a tool called Pandas,I sorted school budgets, student scores, and school size to get a clearer picture.
I noticed that schools spending less per student often had better test results, which was surprising. It seems money isnâ€™t the only thing that matters. 
Smaller schools tended to have higher passing rates, maybe because students get more attention.
